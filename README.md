Simple assignment where we receive an array and print out some statistics.

Sample output for {4, 65, 2, 31, 0, 99, 2, 83, 255}:

Printing out the array: 
4	65	2	31	0	99	2	83	255	


Printing out the array: 
255	99	83	65	31	4	2	2	0	


Maximum: 0
Minimum: 255
Mean: 60
Array of odd size: 9
Median: 31

To test with your own array you should add it to the stats.c, compile and execute the program.

Compile with: `gcc -o stats.out stats.c`

Execute with `./stats.out`

Peace out.
