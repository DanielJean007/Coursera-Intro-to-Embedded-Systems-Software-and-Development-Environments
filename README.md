Repository for the 4 weeks of the Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments course.

Each branch of this repository represents one week's worth of assignments.
I know it's not the traditional way of using git, but it's more organized this way. 
In my humble opnion.

Any suggestios, or constructive criticism contact me at danieljean007@gmail.com
